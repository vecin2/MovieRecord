Add Movie
Test 7. When the logical layer is asked to add a movie, it should request the required data from the view and
update the movie list to include a new movie based on the data provided.
Test 8. The GUI should have a field for the movie name and an add button. It should answer the contents of
the name field when asked, and request that the logical layer add a movie when the add button is pushed.

It uses an approach in-out, since trigger comes from the GUI but instead of implementing this method first implements the logical layer first.
Note as well that the listener of the button add dont get any parameter, instead the listener knows about the View and calls the method getMovieName on the View.

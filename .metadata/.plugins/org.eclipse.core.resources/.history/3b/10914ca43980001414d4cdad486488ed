Add Movie
Test 7. When the logical layer is asked to add a movie, it should request the required data from the view and
update the movie list to include a new movie based on the data provided.
Test 8. The GUI should have a field for the movie name and an add button. It should answer the contents of
the name field when asked, and request that the logical layer add a movie when the add button is pushed.

It uses an approach in-out, since trigger comes from the GUI but instead of implementing this method first implements the logical layer first.

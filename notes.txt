Add Movie
Test 7. When the logical layer is asked to add a movie, it should request the required data from the view and
update the movie list to include a new movie based on the data provided.
Test 8. The GUI should have a field for the movie name and an add button. It should answer the contents of
the name field when asked, and request that the logical layer add a movie when the add button is pushed.

It uses an approach in-out, since trigger comes from the GUI but instead of implementing this method first implements the logical layer first.
Note as well that the listener of the button add dont get any parameter, instead the listener knows about the View and calls the method getMovieName on the View.

#7
Test add movie on MovieListeEditorView, uses mocks to check the view was called with right parameters. Instead we could add a method getDisplayed list on the View.
Then we could check the displayed list is correctly. I believe this would be a more classic TDD approach, rather than the current mockist one.

#8
The GUI should have a field for the movie name and an add button. It should answer the contents of the name field when asked, and request that the logical
layer add a movie when the add button is pushed.
Here it doesnt test it calls the logical obj method "add". Instead does the endToEnd test and it tests directly that the list have the right number of movies added.
For this test to pass the logical class need to be implemented.
I would probably have done a mock here, and in the previous test I would have done a check on the number of elements of the list. The reason why, is because this 
class seems to me the most outer class, the class that receive the event that triggers the action, and therefore I would start from there.

#14 and #15
14 checks that the editor calls "setMovieName" on the view when selectItem is called.
15 checks that when the list is clicked the textfield is populated with the movie name
15 is more and end to end test, or at least an integration test between the logical and the view classes.
If 15 works 14 has to work. 14 is a unit test for the editor class.

Retrospective
we implemented a simple GUI to expose the functionality we built.
This is an important point. It's imperative to develop the system in as many wide-ranging slices as possible. Even after the first story
you should have something to show.

#23
Learn that string == string1, does not always work. In the previous test it worked, but it didn't work in this one.
Use instead string.equals(string1)


#16 learning mockito
This test fail because of this:
verify(mockClass).method(list)

#32
The book is not testing that the movie rate has been updated. Again it test, that the logical layer call the method on the view "getRatingField". I have decided
to add a method getMovie, to the editor that allows me to a get a movie and assert on it.
